Below are the descriptions of examples of how to use the tools.

## settimer
The tool `settimer` requires a single parameter `minutes` which is an integer.

If you want to set a timer for 10 minutes, write the following:
<action>
    <tool>settimer</tool>
    <minutes>10</minutes>
</action>


## insertafterline
The tool `insertafterline` requires 3 parameters, filename, linebefore, content.

If you want to insert text at some location in a text file
<action>
    <tool>insertafterline</tool>
    <filename>/home/ec2-user/projects/playground/yo.txt</filename>
    <linebefore>2</linebefore>
    <content>B = 7</content>
</action>
This would insert "B = 7" after line 2 in yo.txt

## replacelineswith
The tool `replacelineswith` requires 4 parameters: The filename, the startline (inclusive), endline (inclusive), and the new content.

You would use it like this

    <filename>/home/ec2-user/projects/playground/yo.txt</filename>
    <startline>7</startline>
    <endline>8</endline>
    <newcontent># this is a comment</newcontent>
